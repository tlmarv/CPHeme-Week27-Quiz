        "Tricuspid valve"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 5,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is the tricuspid valve (F). This valve separates the right atrium from the right ventricle. The aortic valve (A) is a structure separating the left ventricle from the systemic circulation. The fossa ovalis (B) and interatrial septum (C) are structures between the right atrium and left atrium, with the former being a remnant of the embryologic foramen ovale. The mitral valve (D) separates the left atrium from the left ventricle. The pulmonary valve (E) separates the right ventricle from the pulmonary circulation."

    "question": "Which part of the heart does the left circumflex artery supply?",
    "choices": [
        "Interventricular septum",
        "Left atrium",
        "Right atrium",
        "Right ventricle",
        "SA node"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is the left atrium (B). The left circumflex is a branch of the left main coronary artery, traveling posteriorly to supply the left atrium and the left ventricle. The interventricular septum (A) is supplied by the LAD. The right atrium (C) is supplied by branches of the right coronary artery. The right ventricle (D) is mostly supplied by the right marginal branch and the LAD. The SA node (E) is supplied by the SA nodal branch."

{
    "question": "Which coronary artery gives rise to the posterior descending artery in the majority of the population?",
    "choices": [
        "Left anterior descending artery",
        "Left circumflex artery",
        "Left main coronary artery",
        "Right coronary artery",
        "Right marginal artery"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 3,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is right coronary artery (D). The majority of the population have a dominant right coronary artery (RCA). This means that the posterior descending artery (PDA) is a branch of the RCA. The left anterior descending artery (A) does not usually give off branches to the PDA. The left circumflex artery (B) can give rise to the PDA in a smaller proportion of the population, creating a dominant left coronary artery. The left main (C) does not give branches to the PDA directly. The right marginal artery (E) is not directly associated with the PDA."

{
    "question": "What cardiac vein accompanies the right coronary artery along its route?",
    "choices": [
        "Anterior veins of the right ventricle",
        "Great cardiac vein",
        "Middle cardiac vein",
        "Posterior cardiac vein",
        "Small cardiac vein"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 4,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is small cardiac vein (E). The small cardiac vein runs in the right atrioventricular groove, accompanying the right coronary artery. The anterior veins of the right ventricle (A) are not closely associated with the right coronary artery. The great cardiac vein (B) runs on the anterior interventricular groove, accompanying the left anterior descending artery. The middle cardiac vein (C) runs on the posterior interventricular groove, accompanying the posterior descending artery. The posterior cardiac vein (D) runs on the posterior surface of the left ventricle. It does not accompany any of the main coronary arteries."

    "question": "Which additional heart sound can be normal in pregnant women?",
    "choices": [
        "Fixed-split S2",
        "Reversed splitting (also called paradoxical splitting)",
        "S3",
        "S4",
        "Wide-splitting S2"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is S3 (C). The S3 gallop can be normal in pregnant women, athletes, and children. Fixed-split S2 is a sign of atrial septal defect (A). Reversed splitting is caused by aortic stenosis (B). S4 is a sign of noncompliant heart walls and is always pathologic (D). Wide-splitting S2 occurs in pulmonary arterial hypertension, pulmonic stenosis, and right bundle-branch block (E)."
},
{
    "question": "A 52-year-old man comes to the office for a follow-up of his heart failure condition. On auscultation of his heart, an S4 sound is heard. What is the most likely cause of this additional heart sound in this patient?",
    "choices": [
        "Atrial septal defect",
        "Heart block",
        "Ventricular hypertrophy",
        "Volume overload"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is ventricular hypertrophy (C). An S4 sound comes before S1, signifying a stiff, noncompliant ventricle that recoils against the atrial kick. This is seen in ventricular hypertrophy. Atrial septal defect (A) does not cause an S4 sound. Heart block (B) and volume overload (D) are associated with S3 sounds, not S4."
},
{
    "question": "While examining a patient, you notice that the second heart sound is split while the patient is inhaling. You have her exhale, and you hear a single second heart sound. What sign is this and what is its significance?",
    "choices": [
        "Fixed splitting of S2, a sign of atrial septal defect",
        "Normal splitting of S2, a physiologic finding",
        "Paradoxical splitting, a sign of aortic stenosis",
        "Wide splitting of S2, a sign of right bundle-branch block, pulmonic stenosis, or pulmonary arterial hypertension"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is normal splitting of S2, a physiologic finding (B). S2 is normally singular during expiration and splits during inspiration. Fixed splitting (A) occurs in atrial septal defect and is constant across respiratory phases. Paradoxical splitting (C) involves a split during expiration that resolves in inspiration, seen in conditions like aortic stenosis. Wide splitting (D) is observed when the split persists and increases during inspiration, seen in right bundle-branch block or pulmonary hypertension."

    "question": "Which of the following describes the normal order of cardiac conduction in healthy individuals?",
    "choices": [
        "AV node, bundle branches, bundle of His, SA node, Purkinje fibers",
        "Bundle branches, SA node, AV node, Purkinje fibers, bundle of His",

        "SA node, Purkinje fibers, bundle of His, bundle branches, AV node"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 3,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is SA node, AV node, bundle of His, bundle branches, Purkinje fibers (D). The electrical impulse begins at the SA node, travels to the AV node and then to the bundle of His, goes to the right and left bundle branches, and then goes to the Purkinje fibers. Other options incorrectly describe the sequence of conduction."

        "Influx of calcium",
        "Influx of potassium",
        "Influx of sodium"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 4,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is influx of sodium (E). The pacemaker current, part of phase 4 of pacemaker cells, represents the influx of sodium into the cell. Efflux of potassium (A) occurs during phase 3 (repolarization), and the other options represent phases unrelated to If activity."

    "question": "How does the sympathetic nervous system increase the heart rate in normal individuals?",
    "choices": [
        "Decreases the slope of phase 2",
        "Decreases the slope of phase 4",
        "Increases the hyperpolarization for phase 3",
        "Increases the slope of phase 4",
        "Increases the threshold for phase 0"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 3,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is increases the slope of phase 4 (D). The sympathetic nervous system increases the slope of phase 4 in pacemaker cells, leading to faster depolarization and a higher heart rate. Other options describe effects that either do not occur or would reduce heart rate."

    "question": "A cylindrical blood vessel with laminar flow of blood is dilated such that its radius doubles from 1 cm to 2 cm. The pressure differential between the ends of the blood vessel, the length of the blood vessel, and the viscosity of the blood all remain unchanged. What is the effect on flow of blood?",
    "choices": [
        "Blood flow decreases by a factor of 2",
        "Blood flow decreases by a factor of 16",
        "Blood flow increases by a factor of 2",
        "Blood flow increases by a factor of 4",
        "Blood flow increases by a factor of 16"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 4,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is blood flow increases by a factor of 16 (E). According to the Hagen-Poiseuille relationship, flow is directly proportional to the radius of the blood vessel raised to the fourth power. This means that doubling the radius leads to an increase in blood flow by a factor of 16. Other options incorrectly describe the relationship between radius and blood flow, which is exponential rather than linear."

{
    "question": "A cylindrical blood vessel with a given tension and wall thickness becomes aneurysmal such that its new radius is twice the original radius. Which of the following is true about the tension on the aneurysmal vessel?",
    "choices": [
        "Tension will decrease by a factor of 2",
        "Tension will decrease by a factor of 4",
        "Tension will increase by a factor of 2",
        "Tension will increase by a factor of 4",
        "Tension will remain the same"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is tension will increase by a factor of 2 (C). According to Laplace's law, tension is directly proportional to the radius of the vessel, assuming all other factors remain constant. If the radius doubles, so will the tension, increasing the likelihood of vessel rupture. Other options either underestimate or fail to account for this direct proportionality."

{
    "question": "Which of the following action potential features is unique to fast-type cardiac action potentials?",
    "choices": [
        "Potassium ion–mediated repolarization of phase 3",
        "Magnesium-driven resting potential",
        "Pacemaker potential of phase 4",
        "Plateau phase 2",
        "Slow upstroke of depolarization"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 3,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is plateau phase 2 (D). The plateau phase is unique to fast-type action potentials, caused by a balance between calcium influx through L-type calcium channels and potassium efflux through voltage-gated potassium channels. Potassium-mediated repolarization (A) is not unique to fast-type action potentials. Magnesium (B) is not involved in action potential generation. The pacemaker potential (C) and slow upstroke (E) are features of slow-type potentials."

    "question": "Which of the following describes the general state of sodium channels during the absolute refractory period?",
    "choices": [
        "Activated",
        "Deactivated",
        "Closed",
        "Inactivated",
        "Open"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 3,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is inactivated (D). During the absolute refractory period, sodium channels are inactivated, preventing depolarization. Activated (A) and open (E) allow sodium ions to enter the cell. Closed (C) refers to the initial closing of the inactivation gate, while deactivated (B) is not a recognized term for sodium channel states."
},
{
    "question": "Which of the following causes sodium channels to transition from closed to inactivated?",
    "choices": [
        "Acidosis",
        "Alkalosis",
        "Depolarization",
        "Hyperpolarization",
        "Sodium ion influx"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is depolarization (C). Depolarization triggers the inactivation of sodium channels after opening. Acidosis (A) and alkalosis (B) have no role in this process. Hyperpolarization (D) is not involved, and sodium ion influx (E) occurs during depolarization but does not cause the transition to inactivation."
},
{
    "question": "Which of the following is caused by hyperkalemia?",
    "choices": [
        "Acid reflux",
        "Insulin dependence",
        "Relative depolarization",
        "Relative hyperpolarization",
        "Sodium channel closing"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is relative depolarization (C). Hyperkalemia increases extracellular potassium levels, reducing the resting membrane potential and causing relative depolarization. It does not cause acid reflux (A) or insulin dependence (B). Hypokalemia, not hyperkalemia, can cause hyperpolarization (D). Sodium channel closing (E) occurs during depolarization but is not specific to hyperkalemia."
